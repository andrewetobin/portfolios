## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### (Rails Mini Project)

* [Github link](https://github.com/andrewetobin/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

(This project uses Ruby, rails, and ActiveRecord to build a site that stores ideas for an individual. Includes CRUD functionality.)

This project was a solo project. I learned to work through challenges independently as well as reach out for ideas on occasion. Main challenge was implementing admin authorization on first exposure. Utulized several resources, but was able to get functioning by deadline. I enjoyed the styling aspects of the project. I also really enjoyed the concept of the project. I often have ideas, or thoughts on how to plan or improve an idea. On several occasions I wished I had an app where I could add notes to an idea. Add things to look into, problems to look out for, resources available, etc.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Little Shop)

* [Github link](https://github.com/Autumn-Martin/little-shop-redux)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/little-shop-redux)

Use Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a site that shows items by categories and analyzes those items..

evaluation comments: one spot with ruby code in models that could be drastically improved.

Meets Expectations in all categories


#### (Job Tracker)

* [Github link](https://github.com/andrewetobin/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/job-tracker)

Add additional functionality for a personal job tracking app. Project is designed to track job opportunities an individual may find interesting.

evaluation comments:
Challenges - ActiveRecord and Styling. Routes and what params are available depending on where you are at.
On Jobs controller, maybe a few too many instance variables @headers.
Make sure you have model tests for all methods.
UI - the dashboard is pretty hard to read.
Missing links for jobs index sorted by location/interest
Meets Expectations in all categories

#### (Bike Share)

* [Github link](https://github.com/mikecm1141/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/bike-share-redux)

This application uses Ruby on Rails and ActiveRecord to analyze data from a Bay Area bike share program. Data explored includes general stats along with usage stats. The usage stats will be particularly helpful in creating relationships with local business for mutual benefit. As well as showing financial impact for immediate communities near a proposed new bike docking station. Data also includes weather information for all days.

Also included is a bike shop where visitors are able to peruse bike accessories. Visitors are able to create an account in order to login and checkout their cart.
