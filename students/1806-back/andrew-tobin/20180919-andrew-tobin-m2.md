Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?

Yes, it was extremely helpful. Learned many on my own and met with my mentor over course of mod to help with questions I had.


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  I really enjoyed Bike Share. I felt like it helped to bring all of the puzzle pieces together. Its size demands that everyone learn parts of the entire project. Tons of CRUD, testing, and routes. Brought everything we learned together in a large project. I actually ride a Denver Bcyle(a similar Bikeshare program here in Denver) to school everyday. I have often wondered who rides the bikes, how often they get used, the hottest locations, events, etc. The dashboard analytics were fun to look over. I used to live in the bay area, and I kept thinking about what Denver's stats would like. Fun project to see first hand how great data is produced.
  LittleShop was my least favorite. I think it was due to getting the project done while being exposed to a bunch of brand new material for the first time.  Learning Sinatra, styling, routes, a new testing program. Despite being the project I liked the best. It was helpful in learning how to produce a website and begin to understand all the different parts needed.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I learned to work through challenges independently as well as reach out for ideas on occasion. Main challenge was implementing admin authorization on first exposure. Utulized several resources, but was able to get functioning by deadline. I enjoyed the styling aspects of the project. I also really enjoyed the concept of the project. I often have ideas, or thoughts on how to plan or improve an idea. On several occasions I wished I had an app where I could add notes to an idea. Add things to look into, problems to look out for, resources available, etc.
What did you learn from your paired projects?
  Workflow, more familiar with github. Very much enjoyed working with all of my project partners. Especially enjoyed Waffle. those really help to keep everyone dialed in with where the project is at. What has been completed? Who is working on what right now? What needs to be done next? Waffle is an excellent workflow management tool.
